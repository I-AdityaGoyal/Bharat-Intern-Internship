# Bharat-Intern-Internship 

Welcome to the Bharat Intern Internship repository! This repository contains all the tasks and projects covered during my machine learning internship at Bharat Intern.

I have been selected as a machine learning intern at Bharat Intern, and this repository serves as a documentation of the tasks and projects I have worked on during my internship.

## Tasks

The tasks completed during the internship include, but are not limited to:

1. Task 1: House Price Prediction
   - Description: Develop a machine learning model to predict house prices based on a given dataset.
   - Files: `House_Price_Prediction.ipynb`, `data.csv`

2. Task 2: Wine Quality Prediction 
   - Description: Build a machine learning model to predict the quality of wines from a provided dataset.
   - Files: `Wine_Quality_Prediction.ipynb`, `data.csv`

3. Task 3: Iris Flowers Classification
   - Description: Implement a machine learning model to classify Iris flowers into different species.
   - Files: `Iris_Flowers_Classification.ipynb`, `data.csv`

Feel free to explore each task's folder to find the relevant code, data, and documentation.

## Setup

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:
